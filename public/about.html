        <p>
            Carpenter by trade. I have been working in construction <br/>
            for about 15 years.
        </p>
        <p>I have always been interested in anything related to <br/>
            tech and was looking to get into game development, <br/>
            but have taken a real interest in web development and <br/>
            the rest, as they say, is history.
